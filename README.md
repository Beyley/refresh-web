# Refresh Website

This is just a WIP prototype/proof-of-concept for how the website will function.
**THIS IS NOT THE FINAL LOOK AND FEEL OF THE WEBSITE**

It's basically just a wrapper around the Refresh v2 API

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.4.
You can set up an Angular environment using [this guide](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` in a terminal for a development server that listens at `http://localhost:4200/`.
The page will automatically refresh itself when source code is changed.

Make sure you are also running Refresh *(or a server compatible with the refresh v2 api)* at `http://localhost:10061` or else the website will be completely useless
