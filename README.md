# Refresh Website

This is a work-in-progress project intending to build a proper frontend for [Refresh](https://github.com/LittleBigRefresh/Refresh).

![A look at the front page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40577357/223408794-b6483642-ab7b-4242-becd-8de5a6e331f6.png)

Design/structure is WIP. Suggestions and criticism are welcome!

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.4.
You can set up an Angular environment using [this guide](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` in a terminal for a development server that listens at `http://localhost:4200/`.
The page will automatically refresh itself when source code is changed.

Make sure you are also running Refresh *(or a server compatible with the refresh v2 api)* at `http://localhost:10061` or else the website will be completely useless
